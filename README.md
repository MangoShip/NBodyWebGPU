# N-Body Simulation

A Particle Simulation of N-Body Problem using different techniques like Web Workers, QuadTree, SharedArrayBuffer, and WebGPU

# Running the Simulation
- Use Google Chrome Canary with SharedArrayBuffer enabled.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- In order to compile the project: `npm run dev`
- To run a local server: `ws` and navigate to http://localhost:8000
